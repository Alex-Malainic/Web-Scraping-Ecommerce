# big-ecommerce-scrape

This code performs web scraping over a big ecommerce site. 
Given the complexity of a website, I made it so it only scrapes over a few categories which can be given as an argument in the function. 
At the moment it extract the product ID, name, price and the date of extraction. 
If needed, more fields can be added for a broader analysis over the evolution of prices and other indicators.
